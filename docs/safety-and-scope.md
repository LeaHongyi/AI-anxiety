# Safety, Scope, and Boundaries 边界声明、风险提示、遇到危机语句怎么办

## 1) Not medical/clinical
This product is not a medical device and does not provide diagnosis or therapy.
It offers educational and self-reflection support for AI-related worry.

## 2) What we do NOT do
- No predictions about specific job loss timelines
- No “guarantees” about career outcomes
- No advice that replaces professional mental health or career services

## 3) Crisis / Self-harm signals
If user expresses self-harm intent or imminent danger:
- Stop the job-replacement flow
- Encourage immediate help:
  - Contact local emergency services
  - Reach out to trusted people nearby
  - Seek professional support
- Keep response short, supportive, and action-oriented

(Implementation note for MVP: keyword + heuristic detection)

## 4) Privacy
For MVP:
- Prefer local-only storage
- If logging is enabled: anonymize and minimize data
- Do not store free-form sensitive text unless necessary

## 5) Tone constraints (especially for high neuroticism)
- Avoid catastrophic language
- Avoid long explanations
- Prefer grounding + micro-action
